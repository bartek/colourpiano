Colour Piano
-------

This is a poorly coded and hacked up app for Pixel Hack Day in Toronto (http://pixelhackday.com/)

You should not use the code in this app as a reference for .. anything.

The original idea was to feed images into the TinEye API, and using their PixSimilar API fetch images
based on a certain colour. The on-screen piano/keyboard is colour coded and would display images
from the API of that colour.

Unfortunately, TinEye backed down so I spent too much time doing my own colour detection rather than making the app sweet. Owell!

Images would come from the 500px, as its known for its beautiful images.

When keys are pressed, images float onto the screen. Since my jQuery manipulation/animation skills
are atrocious, the effect here is garbage, but I guess you can see what I was going for :)

I threw in some SoundCloud API code, which is really cool and easy to use for some beats.
